This repository contains my notes and explorations of go. Inspired by Josh Duffney's [Everything I Know About Go](https://github.com/Duffney/everything-i-know-about-go).

## Contents

* **[API](api/):** A REST API written in Go, using things like [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) and middlewares. Plus an interesting foray into how to write integration tests in a re-usable / portalbe way.
* **[ast](ast/):** An exploration of using [`ast`](https://pkg.go.dev/go/ast) and related packages to parse and use metadata in Go files.
