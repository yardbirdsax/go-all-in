This repository contains my notes and explorations of go. Inspired by Josh Duffney's [Everything I Know About Go](https://github.com/Duffney/everything-i-know-about-go).

## Contents

* **[API](api/):** A REST API written in Go, using things like [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)
  and middlewares. Plus an interesting foray into how to write integration tests in a re-usable /
  portalbe way.
* **[Middleware](middleware/):** Explorations around how to do HTTP middleware in Go. Generically
  implemented without following any given framework.
* **[Testing](testing/):** Stuff around, well, how to test stuff!
