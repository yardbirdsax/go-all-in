This repository contains my notes and explorations of go. Inspired by Josh Duffney's [Everything I Know About Go](https://github.com/Duffney/everything-i-know-about-go).

## Contents

* **[API](api/):** A REST API written in Go, using things like [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) and middlewares. Plus an interesting foray into how to write integration tests in a re-usable / portalbe way.
